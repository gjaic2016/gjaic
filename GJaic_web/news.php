					<h1>AKAI</h1>
					<div id="meta" > 10.10.2016 | G.J. | Welcome </div>
					<p>The biggest open secret in music tech over the last few months has been the fact that Akai are set
					to hit NAMM with two new MPCs. Thanks to leaked documents confirmed in the last few days by Akai, we know 
					that the latest additions to the iconic sampler/sequencer workstation range are both standalone instruments, 
					not requiring a computer like the other current models in the MPC range. The MPC Live is like a standalone 
					MPC Touch, while the MPC X is a new flagship model. Both run an updated version 2.0 of the MPC software, 
					introducing new features and standalone functionality.</p>

					<p>January 13, 1910 is celebrated as the first public radio broadcast in history, when Italian tenor Enrico Caruso and 
					Czech soprano Emmy Destinn took to the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, and their performances of 
					arias from Tosca were broadcast wirelessly. From that first broadcast, to FDR’s legendary "Fireside Chats," to Orson Welles’ 
					“The War of the Worlds,” to the rise of National Public Radio (NPR), and now podcasts and live-streams, our world has been 
					transformed by the voices and sounds coming over the airwaves. But behind the great moment in history that started it all 
					was the work of many important people.</p>

					<h1>Could a new sound format change music production?</h1>
					<div id="meta" > 12.10.2016 | G.J. | Last </div>
					<p>DJ and producer Prime Cuts from the Scratch Perverts explains why he's using a new music format called Stems, 
					which has been developed by Native Instruments.</br>
					Stems software splits a track into four separate musical elements: drums, bass line, melody and vocals.</br>
					Prime Cuts tells BBC Click's LJ Rich that rather than making life easier for a DJ, the creative options the format brings are 'vast'.</br></p>
