					<p>About 17 years after Leon Scott's first recording, Thomas Edison invented the Phonograph. 
					This offered a way to record and play music/sounds. The first released recording on the Wax Cylinders 
					was a recording of Edison reciting "Mary had a little lamb" All early recordings were direct to disc. 
					To record, the band (or speaker) would play into a horn which recorded it on to the wax cylinders. 
					The wax cylinders would the reproduce the sound when played back. These were sold as the first personal 
					recording device. </p>

					<p>Music producers use their extensive musical and technical studio experience to oversee all 
					aspects of a recording session, including assisting with mixing, mastering, and recording. This 
					occupation is ideal for those with a keen ear who love keeping up with the latest songs and recording 
					artists. Although educational requirements vary, a bachelor's degree in music production is the most 
					common credential for aspiring music producers. These programs sometimes include an internship that 
					provides experience overseeing the entire production process.</p>
